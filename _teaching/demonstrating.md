During my PhD, I have demonstrated for a number of undergraduate courses.

MT2000 Python Workshop
======
An introductory course to programming, taught in Python. I was an assistant
demonstrator, helping students with any problems they had.

MT2504 Combinatorics and Probability Computing Project
======
Students taking MT2504 were required to complete a project on combinatorics in
Python; I was an assistant demonstrator and marked half of the solutions. 

MT2505 Abstract Algebra
======
Students taking MT2505 were required to complete a significant project on
combinatorics in Python; I was an assistant demonstrator and marker, and also
wrote an automated test suite to help mark the solutions.

MathsBase
======
I assisted at a drop-in session for undergraduates with questions about any
sub-honours mathematics modules.
